This is the short talk on the [Tenacity](https://github.com/jd/tenacity) Python library at the September 2017 [An Evening of Python Coding](https://www.meetup.com/austinpython/) event. Original file download from [github](https://github.com/camisatx/2017-Evening-of-Python-Coding).

Additional package I installed to run this notebook: `monotonic`.
It is good to know [Decorators](https://www.thecodeship.com/patterns/guide-to-python-function-decorators/) in Python.


Tenacity is a library that uses decorators to **retry** a specific task after an Exception occurs. Retrying occurs at the specified intervals for a specified duration.

View the notebook [here](tenacity.ipynb).
