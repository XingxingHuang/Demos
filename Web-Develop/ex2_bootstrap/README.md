I use the version bootstrap-3.3.7 download from [http://getbootstrap.com/](http://getbootstrap.com/). You can find the version by click the top right corner.

File `bootstrap.css` is download from the website. 
Fiel `basics.html` is what you can play arround.

### Matierals 
Offical [bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com). 

Check the [Introduction](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/getting-started/introduction/) for a quick start. 
Check the [Components](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/components/alerts/) or other resources to check how to change settings. It just a document for referrence, do not need to look the whole pages.
